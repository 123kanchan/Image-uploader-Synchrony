# Image-uploader-Synchrony
This is a Spring Boot 3.x REST API that enables user registration, authentication, and image management via the Imgur API. Users can sign up with a username and password, upload images, view their profile along with uploaded images, and delete images after authentication. 
The application follows a three-layer architecture (Controller, Service, Repository) and uses H2 in-memory database for storing user credentials securely. 
Spring Security (Basic Auth) is implemented for authentication, and JUnit tests ensure code quality. 
The project is built using Java 17 and leverages Spring Bootâ€™s RESTful capabilities for seamless integration with Imgur.
